# POE Stash Auditor

*POE Stash Audito lets you calculate the total value of alll items in each of your stash tabs.*

*The program is quite similar to __Stash Appraiser__ and is by no means a replacement for it as __stash appraiser__ is alot lighter. This is just a more powerful version that supports all items except for gems and maps. It also gives you the stack size of each item and the total value of the stack.*



## Setup
*The setup process is quite simple*
1. Download the program from the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/eslam-allam/POE-stash-Auditor/releases) or clone the repo.
1. Launch the application and you'll be redirected to the POE website to login and give consent.<br></br>
__POE Stash Auditor will not gain access to anything but your StashTabs and items__

1. Choose the league from the menu then press OK
1. Choose a stash tab then press get prices.(you may set a threshold for the minimum total value you'd like to see)
1. A table of the items and prices will be presented to you.

*If you wish to view the console to see some helpful debugging/progress messages you may click the __Show/Hide Console__ button*

**Please note that Chrome is required for the consent process.**
